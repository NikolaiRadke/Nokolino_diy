This folder contains the 6 page manual as a PDF, written in German. 
  
It has been written with [Scribus](http://www.scribus.net). The source files, fonts and illustrations are
in the folder [/scribus](https://github.com/NikolaiRadke/NOKOlino/tree/master/manual/scribus), so you can change 
the manual as you wish or translate it in any language. Please fork this repository or send a copy.

The other "2in1"-file is intended for printing a smaller manual with two pages on one. Choose duplex, 2 Pages on one and short edge.
